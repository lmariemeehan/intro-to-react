React questions for Mentor:

1. Look at my original "Build component from scratch" html file and tell me why it's not working. I tried building this while looking at Facebook's React instructions and couldn't seem to get it to work. I was able to build a second React component with Bloc's one example just fine though.

2. I'm trying to understand, why are props read-only and not state?? Seems backwards to me.
